    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p><strong>Timeframe(s) Reviewed:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>MTD PM (Feb 01, 2025 - Feb 19, 2025 vs. Jan 01, 2025 - Jan 19, 2025)</li>
      <li>MTD PY (Feb 01, 2025 - Feb 19, 2025 vs. Feb 01, 2024 - Feb 19, 2024)</li>

    </ul>
    <p>
      Recent data signals notable improvements in Marketing Efficiency Ratio (MER) and a slight reduction in Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) for both MTD and MoM periods.  
      However, Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) still lags behind ideal benchmarks, hinting that some channels may require additional creative or budget optimization.  
      Furthermore, changes in <strong>spend mix</strong> show a growing reliance on Facebook and a reduced spend percentage on Non Brand Search and YouTube, potentially influencing short-term gains but calling for deeper channel-by-channel review.

  <!-- (b) Trend Analysis -->
  <section>
    <h2>Trend Analysis</h2>

    <h3>1. MER: MTD PM vs. MTD PY</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MTD PM:</strong> Rose from $2.17 to $3.15 (+45%), Grade: B-</li>
      <li><strong>MTD PY:</strong> Rose from $2.11 to $3.15 (+49%), Grade: B-</li>
      <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Both short-term (MTD PM) and YOY (MTD PY) gains suggest stronger efficiency in revenue generation per marketing dollar. Table 7 references “MER is improving with stable marketing spend” as a possible scenario—indicating improved channel performance and/or more relevant ad creative.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. CPA: MTD PM vs. MTD PY</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MTD PM:</strong> Dropped from $67.50 to $61.70 (-9%), Grade: D+ (still above the ideal industry range)</li>
      <li><strong>MTD PY:</strong> Dropped from $70.74 to $61.70 (-13%), Grade: C-</li>
      <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Although acquisition costs remain relatively high, the consistent downward movement is encouraging. Table 7’s “CPA is decreasing with improving CVR” may apply if we see stable or improved conversion rates. Continual refinement of targeting and creative is advised to push CPA closer to $50 or below.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. ROAS: MoM PM</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MoM PM:</strong> Fell from 56.00% to 35.00% (-37%), Grade: F</li>
      <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Despite the short-term MTD improvements, a full-month view (MoM PM) reveals a substantial drop in overall ad efficiency. This might be linked to a shift in budget toward lower-performing channels or creative fatigue. Table 7’s “ROAS is declining despite stable CVR” suggests rechecking audience segmentation and creative effectiveness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Spend Mix: MTD PM &amp; MoM PM</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MTD PM – Facebook:</strong> Increased from 80% to 86% (+7%)</li>
      <li><strong>MoM PM – Facebook:</strong> Also increased from 75% to 81% (+8%)</li>
      <li><strong>MoM PM – Non Brand Search:</strong> Decreased from 8% to 7% (-20%)</li>
      <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> A larger portion of the budget is going to Facebook, while Non Brand Search and YouTube allocations declined. This shift may explain the improved MER if Facebook campaigns are outperforming other channels. However, overconcentration in a single channel carries risk if performance falters. Per Table 7’s “Increasing spend_mix_% with improving ROAS,” it’s beneficial if the channel is high-ROI, but continued monitoring is critical to avoid overspend in a single area.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- (c) Key Questions -->
  <section>
    <h2>Key Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>How can we further reduce CPA to align with benchmarks while scaling volume across high-potential channels like Facebook?</li>
      <li>Are other channels (e.g., YouTube or Non Brand Search) truly underperforming, or is the reduced spend simply overshadowing their potential ROAS?</li>
      <li>Does the MoM ROAS dip reflect channel fatigue or creative inefficiency, and how can we mitigate it next month?</li>
      <li>Do changes in spend mix reflect a strategic choice (Facebook’s strong performance) or a risk of over-reliance on one channel?</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- (d) Recommendations -->
  <section>
    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Review Channel Efficiency &amp; Diversification:</strong> While increased Facebook spend boosts MER, consider retaining a baseline in Non Brand Search or YouTube to maintain diverse lead sources and reduce reliance on a single channel.</li>
      <li><strong>Enhance Creative Testing for Underperforming Channels:</strong> If Non Brand Search or YouTube are no longer profitable, run A/B tests on messaging and audiences. Table 7’s “Significant decrease in spend_mix_% for a high-performing channel” warns against prematurely cutting budgets if the channel has historically delivered positive ROI.</li>
      <li><strong>Address the ROAS Drop in MoM PM:</strong> Evaluate any abrupt changes in creative or targeting last month. Revisit audience segmentation and reallocate budget to campaigns with consistent returns, referencing Table 7’s “ROAS is declining despite stable CVR” for further diagnostic steps.</li>
      <li><strong>Continue CPA Optimization:</strong> Maintain the downward momentum in CPA with more granular targeting. Verify that cost cuts are not harming lead quality by reviewing returning-customer metrics and average order values.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <!-- (e) Conclusion -->
  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Overall, the business benefits from a stronger MER and gradual CPA declines, suggesting more efficient use of marketing spend—especially via Facebook.  
      Nonetheless, the MoM ROAS slump, along with shifts in spend mix away from other channels, could pose risks if performance on Facebook stagnates.  
      By refining creative strategies, ensuring adequate channel diversification, and continually monitoring spend mix, the business can sustain short-term gains and address the longer-term challenge of boosting ROAS.

      Current performance indicators present a mixed landscape. While Marketing Efficiency Ratio (MER) shows improvement in the short-term (MTD PM), other critical metrics like Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) remain high across all time periods. 
      The shift in <strong>spend mix</strong> towards Applovin and away from Facebook, especially noted in MTD comparisons, needs careful evaluation to determine its long-term impact on key performance indicators.  
      Overall, a holistic review of channel effectiveness and budget allocation is essential.

    <h2>Trend Analysis</h2>
    <h3>1. MER: MTD PM vs. MTD PY</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MTD PM:</strong> Rose from $1.29 to $1.64 (+28%), Grade: A+</li>
      <li><strong>MTD PY:</strong> Rose from $1.49 to $1.64 (+10%), Grade: B+</li>
      <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Improvement in MER indicates a more efficient conversion of marketing spend into revenue compared to both the previous month (MTD PM) and the same period last year (MTD PY). As Table 7 indicates, this could be attributed to improved channel performance or strategic ad placements.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2. CPA: MTD PM & MTD PY</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MTD PM:</strong> Decreased from $97.35 to $95.23 (-2%), Grade: B-</li>
      <li><strong>MTD PY:</strong> Increased from $80.47 to $95.23 (+18%), Grade: F</li>
      <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Although CPA decreased slightly compared to the previous month (MTD PM), it significantly increased compared to the same period last year (MTD PY). Per Table 7, "CPA is increasing with stable CVR" may apply, indicating aggressive bidding or ineffective creative.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3. ROAS: MoM PY & QTD PY</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MoM PY:</strong> Decreased from 82% to 72% (-13%), Grade: D-</li>
      <li><strong>QTD PY:</strong> Decreased from 82% to 75% (-8%), Grade: D</li>
      <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The decline in ROAS over both the month (MoM PY) and quarter (QTD PY) compared to the previous year, suggests decreasing returns from ad spending. Table 7 indicates that "ROAS is declining despite stable CVR" might apply, suggesting the need to revisit audience segmentation and creative effectiveness.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>4. CPM: MTD PY & MoM PY & QTD PY</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MTD PY:</strong> Decreased from 3% to 2% (-29%), Grade: A+</li>
      <li><strong>MoM PY:</strong> Decreased from 3% to 1% (-47%), Grade: A+</li>
      <li><strong>QTD PY:</strong> Decreased from 3% to 2% (-42%), Grade: A+</li>
      <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The consistent decrease in CPM across these three periods (MTD PY, MoM PY & QTD PY) suggests increasing cost efficiency for impressions. As Table 7 suggests for "CPM is decreasing alongside CPC", this can be linked to consolidating spend on cost-effective placements.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>5. CPC: MTD PM</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MTD PM:</strong> Increased from $1.63 to $1.81 (+12%), Grade: D-</li>
      <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The increase in CPC indicates a higher cost per click compared to the previous month. Following Table 7's logic, this suggests a rise in auction competitiveness or less effective ad targeting.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>6. Marketing Spend Ratio: MTD PM vs. MTD PY</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MTD PM:</strong> Decreased from 78% to 61% (-22%), Grade: A+</li>
      <li><strong>MTD PY:</strong> Decreased from 67% to 61% (-9%), Grade: A-</li>
      <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The marketing spend ratio decreased significantly (MTD PM) compared to the previous month and moderately (MTD PY) when compared to the same month last year. According to Table 7, "MSR is improving with marketing spend decrease," which points to possibly redirecting investments to high-ROI channels.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Spend Mix Analysis</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MTD PM & MTD PY â€“ Applovin:</strong> Increased from 6% to 10% (+74%) & increased from 0% to 10% respectively.</li>
      <li><strong>MTD PM & MTD PY â€“ Facebook:</strong> Decreased from 79% to 71% (-9%) & decreased from 89% to 71% respectively.</li>
      <li><strong>QTD PQ â€“ YouTube:</strong> Decreased from 8% to 2% (-73%)</li>
      <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> There's a notable shift in spend mix. Applovin's budget share increased considerably, particularly versus last year, while Facebook's share decreased, especially in the MTD timeframe. YouTube has significantly decreased in QTD PQ. Table 7 notes that a "Significant increase in spend_mix_% for a low-performing channel" means that Applovin requires closer performance monitoring to validate its increased budget allocation. Reduced investment in Facebook and YouTube, which are likely high performing channels, can impact overall reach, potentially affecting the overall marketing effectiveness.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Key Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Why is CPA still high despite improvements in MER?</li>
      <li>What is the impact of shifting spend mix from Facebook and YouTube to Applovin? Is Applovin delivering the expected returns?</li>
      <li>How can the decline in ROAS over MoM PY and QTD PY be addressed?</li>
      <li>Is the increase in CPC (MTD PM) due to external factors (increased competition) or internal issues (poor targeting)?</li>
      <li>Are there any specific campaigns or channels driving the improvements in MER, and can these be scaled?</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Optimize CPA:</strong> Implement more granular targeting and A/B test different creative strategies to reduce the high CPA, leveraging insights from Table 7 ("CPA is increasing with stable CVR").</li>
      <li><strong>Evaluate Spend Mix:</strong> Conduct a comprehensive review of Applovin's performance to justify the increased budget allocation. If returns are not satisfactory, reallocate funds back to Facebook or YouTube (see Table 7's "Significant decrease in spend_mix_% for a high-performing channel").</li>
      <li><strong>Improve ROAS:</strong> Revisit audience segmentation and creative effectiveness to address the decline in ROAS (reference Table 7's "ROAS is declining despite stable CVR").</li>
      <li><strong>Address CPC Increase:</strong> Identify the causes behind the higher CPC and optimize ad campaigns to improve ad relevance and reduce costs.</li>
      <li><strong>Scale Successful Campaigns:</strong> Identify and scale the campaigns that are contributing to improvements in MER.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      While there are positive trends in MER and Marketing Spend Ratio, high CPA and declining ROAS are major areas of concern. The shift in spend mix warrants close monitoring to validate the effectiveness of Applovin and avoid over-reliance on a potentially underperforming channel. Addressing these issues through targeted optimization and strategic budget allocation will be critical for improving overall marketing performance.

      The overall marketing health presents a mixed picture. While MER has seen some improvements, CPA remains a significant concern across all time periods, consistently scoring an 'F'. ROAS also reflects poor performance, with declining trends in most periods. Changes in <strong>spend mix</strong> reveal shifts from Facebook and Sponsored Products to channels like Amazon DSP, Cannella, and Existing-TBN, requiring careful examination of their impact on overall performance. Decreasing visits despite increased marketing spend in several periods is also a notable concern.

  <!-- (b) Trend Analysis -->
  <section>
    <h2>Trend Analysis</h2>

    <h3>1. MER: MTD PM vs. MTD PY</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MTD PM:</strong> Increased from 3.81 to 4.11 (+8%), Grade: B</li>
      <li><strong>MTD PY:</strong> Decreased slightly from 4.12 to 4.11 (-0.00%), Grade: B-</li>
      <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> MER shows a slight improvement MTD PM. However, when comparing to the same period last year (MTD PY), there is a slight decrease, indicating that the current month's performance is not as efficient as the previous year, even though there's month-over-month growth. According to Table 7, an "MER is improving with stable marketing spend" may apply to the MTD PM increase, suggesting channel improvements or effective ad creative, however it did come with marketing spend decrease, see MSR analysis for further review.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. CPA: MTD PM & MTD PY</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MTD PM:</strong> Increased from $90.71 to $102.34 (+13%), Grade: F</li>
      <li><strong>MTD PY:</strong> Increased from $75.48 to $102.34 (+36%), Grade: F</li>
      <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> CPA has increased significantly in both MTD PM and MTD PY. The MTD PY increase is substantial, indicating a significant rise in the cost to acquire a customer compared to last year. Referencing Table 7, "CPA is increasing with stable CVR" may apply, suggesting that the increased cost is not offset by improved conversion rates, signaling potential issues with bidding strategies or ad relevance. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. ROAS: MTD PM & QTD PY</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MTD PM:</strong> Decreased from 1.13 to 1.01 (-11%), Grade: D-</li>
       <li><strong>QTD PY:</strong> Decreased from 1.41 to 1.07 (-25%), Grade: F</li>
      <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> ROAS is declining both in the short-term (MTD PM) and over a quarterly year-over-year view (QTD PY). The significant drop in QTD PY suggests a concerning trend in ad spend efficiency over a broader period. Table 7's "ROAS is declining despite stable CVR" might be relevant, indicating the need to reassess audience segmentation and creative effectiveness across the campaigns.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Marketing Spend Ratio: MTD PM & QTD PQ</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MTD PM:</strong> Decreased from 26.00% to 24.00% (-7%), Grade: D</li>
      <li><strong>QTD PQ:</strong> Decreased from 27.00% to 25.00% (-7%), Grade: F</li>
      <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The Marketing Spend Ratio (MSR) shows a decrease for both MTD PM and QTD PQ. A decreasing MSR suggests improved revenue efficiency (Table 7 "MSR is improving with marketing spend decrease"). The decrease in spend may point to a better allocation of budget towards higher-ROI channels. MSR is still high in absolute terms which is likely contributing to the poor grade.</li>
    </ul>

     <h3>5. Visits: MTD PM & QTD PQ</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MTD PM:</strong> Decreased from 75,870 to 58,357 (-23%), Grade: NG</li>
      <li><strong>QTD PQ:</strong> Decreased from 285,236 to 166,553 (-42%), Grade: NG</li>
      <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> There's a significant decrease in visits for both MTD PM and QTD PQ. This drop, especially over the quarter (QTD PQ), indicates a concerning decline in site traffic. Referring to Table 7, "Visits are decreasing despite increased marketing spend" may apply, pointing to ineffective creative or incorrect audience targeting.</li>

  <!-- (c) Spend Mix Analysis -->
  <section>
    <h2>Spend Mix Analysis</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MTD PY â€“ Facebook:</strong> Decreased from 15.00% to 7.00% (-56.00%)</li>
      <li><strong>MTD PY â€“ Sponsored Products:</strong> Decreased from 13.00% to 5.00% (-61.00%)</li>
      <li><strong>MTD PY â€“ Amazon DSP:</strong> Increased from 0.00% to 11.00%</li>
      <li><strong>QTD PY â€“ Cannella:</strong> Increased from 16.00% to 30.00% (+83.00%)</li>
      <li><strong>QTD PY â€“ Existing - TBN:</strong> Increased from 10.00% to 20.00% (+96.00%)</li>
      <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> A noticeable shift in spend mix is observed when comparing MTD PY. Facebook and Sponsored Products have seen substantial budget reductions, while Amazon DSP, Cannella, and Existing - TBN have significantly increased. Per Table 7, a "Significant increase in spend_mix_% for a low-performing channel" means that these increases require closer performance monitoring to validate their budget allocation. The decreasing investment in Facebook can impact overall reach.</li>

  <!-- (d) Key Questions -->
  <section>
    <h2>Key Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Why is CPA so high and consistently increasing despite some improvements in MER?</li>
      <li>What is the ROI of channels like Amazon DSP, Cannella, and Existing - TBN, given their increased spend mix?</li>
      <li>How can the declining ROAS across multiple timeframes be addressed?</li>
      <li>What factors are contributing to the decrease in site visits, and how can traffic be restored?</li>
      <li>Are the changes in spend mix justified by improved performance in the channels receiving increased investment?</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- (e) Recommendations -->
  <section>
    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Optimize CPA:</strong> Implement more granular targeting and A/B test different creative strategies to reduce the high CPA, leveraging insights from Table 7 ("CPA is increasing with stable CVR").</li>
      <li><strong>Evaluate Spend Mix:</strong> Conduct a comprehensive review of the performance of Amazon DSP, Cannella, and Existing - TBN to justify the increased budget allocation. If returns are not satisfactory, reallocate funds back to Facebook and Sponsored Products.</li>
      <li><strong>Improve ROAS:</strong> Revisit audience segmentation and creative effectiveness to address the decline in ROAS (reference Table 7's "ROAS is declining despite stable CVR").</li>
      <li><strong>Restore Site Visits:</strong> Investigate the causes behind the declining site visits and re-engage effective marketing channels to boost traffic.</li>
      <li><strong>Monitor MSR:</strong> Continue to monitor the Marketing Spend Ratio (MSR) to ensure efficient use of marketing spend.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <!-- (e) Conclusion -->
  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Overall, the marketing performance shows some areas of concern, particularly with high CPA, declining ROAS, and reduced site visits. The shifts in spend mix require close monitoring to validate the effectiveness of new channels and avoid over-reliance on potentially underperforming areas. Addressing these issues through targeted optimization and strategic budget allocation will be critical for improving overall marketing performance.
