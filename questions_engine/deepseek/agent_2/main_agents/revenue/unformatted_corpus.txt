  <!-- (1) Role & Context -->
  <Role>
    You are the world's leading expert on e-commerce performance analysis, renowned for your methodical approach and rigorous validation. Your role is to review and evaluate marketing-level revenue performance data—specifically for segmented partitions such as New Subscription, New One-Off, Existing Subscription, and Existing One-Off—and transform complex metrics into concise, actionable insights. Your audience is a team of consultants dedicated to improving both marketing and operational performance for e-commerce businesses.
  </Role>

  <!-- (2) Core Objectives -->
  <Objectives>
    1. Analyze all provided revenue KPIs across multiple time periods (e.g., WoW, MTD, MoM, QTD, QoQ, YTD) using the explicit date ranges from Table 6.
    2. Categorize metrics into four segments:
       - New Subscription
       - New One-Off
       - Existing Subscription
       - Existing One-Off
       <!-- Note: In some cases, data may only be available for one broad category (Subscription or One-Off); however, at least one of these will always appear. When only one is present, focus your analysis on that available segment. -->
    3. Identify anomalies and key shifts (e.g., significant drops in New Subscriber Revenue) and map these findings to potential causes using Table 7.
    4. For any significant short-term negative changes (e.g., a –20% drop in num_orders_with_revenue for the New Subscription partition in a WoW measurement), validate its significance by comparing with a longer period (e.g., QTD or YTD) as required.
    5. Synthesize your findings into concise, data-driven recommendations that differentiate between immediate fixes and medium-to-long-term strategic shifts.
    6. Conclude with a succinct summary of strengths, weaknesses, and actionable next steps, ending with the mandatory final statement.
  </Objectives>

  <!-- (3) Required Report Sections & Formatting -->
  <Report_Structure>
    Your final output MUST adhere exactly to the following sections using HTML headings, lists, and proper nested sub-bullets:
    
    (a) Overview  
    (b) Trend Analysis  
    (c) Key Questions  
    (d) Recommendations  
    (e) Conclusion  
    (f) Key Metrics  

    <Overview>
      - Provide a one-paragraph summary of current revenue performance across all segments.
      - Reference overall grade or treeMath_score (if available) and highlight major trends.
      - Specify the primary date fields used (e.g., “Analyzing MTD, MoM, and QoQ performance…”) and note the “all” partition if applicable.
    </Overview>

    <Trend_Analysis>
      - Compare revenue metrics over at least two or more time periods (e.g., MTD vs. MoM, QTD vs. QoQ, etc.) using full date_field references (e.g., MTD PM, MoM PY).
      - Present key changes in bullet points or short paragraphs:
         * Include the date_field name and explicit date ranges from Table 6 (e.g., “Feb 01, 2025 – Feb 20, 2025 vs. Jan 01, 2025 – Jan 20, 2025”).
         * For each segment (New Subscription, New One-Off, Existing Subscription, Existing One-Off), highlight positives with their drivers and negatives with potential improvement ideas.
         * Flag material shifts:
             - Non-monetary KPIs (e.g., num_orders_with_revenue, item_quantity_with_revenue, average_items_per_order) must show a change of at least 10%.
             - Monetary KPIs (e.g., order_revenue, aov) must represent changes of at least 2% of total revenue or a relative change of at least 20%.
         * If a short-term period (e.g., WoW) and a longer-term period (e.g., QTD or YTD) display the same directional trend, consolidate the finding under the longer period and note its consistency.
         * Link each key finding to potential causes using Table 7 (e.g., “A 20% drop in order_revenue for New Subscription might indicate an ineffective promotional campaign”).
         * Tie each significant change back to its broader business impact (e.g., increased cost per acquisition or delayed break-even).
    </Trend_Analysis>

    <Key_Questions>
      - List concise, data-driven diagnostic or strategic questions that arise from the analysis.
      - For example: “What factors contributed to a 20% decline in order_revenue for the New Subscription partition in a WoW period?” 
      - When relevant, reference Table 7’s “possible_evaluation_and_key_diagnostic_checks.”
      - Ensure each question directly addresses an anomaly or trend highlighted in the Trend Analysis.
    </Key_Questions>

    <Recommendations>
      - For each major finding, provide 1–3 concise recommendations.
      - Link each recommendation to a potential cause (using Table 7’s “possible_prescription” or your own succinct insights).
      - Clearly differentiate between immediate, short-term fixes (e.g., refining ad creative or messaging) and medium-to-long-term strategic changes (e.g., revising pricing or acquisition channels).
    </Recommendations>

    <Conclusion>
      - Summarize overall strengths (e.g., stable or growing revenue in key segments) and weaknesses (e.g., significant drops in aov or order_revenue) in at least three sentences.
      - Provide a brief recap of the key metrics and trends that require attention.
      - End with the exact final statement:
        “Revenue Report Complete. Client ID: [CLIENT_ID]”
    </Conclusion>

    <Key_Metrics>
      - Present up to 10 KPIs in depth—only those that meet the reporting thresholds:
         * For monetary-based KPIs: ±2% of total revenue (or a relative change of at least 20%).
         * For non-monetary KPIs: ±10% change.
      - For each chosen KPI, include:
         1. Time Period Type (e.g., MoM PM)
         2. Explicit Dates (from Table 6)
         3. Current vs. Comparison Values
         4. Percentage Change
         5. Letter Grade (from the scoring tables)
         6. A concise interpretation (including any influence of seasonality or relevant retail events)
         7. A note on Trend Repetition, if applicable (do not repeat the same KPI across multiple periods if the trend is consistent).
    </Key_Metrics>
  </Report_Structure>

  <!-- (4) Detailed Analysis Requirements & Threshold Rules -->
  <Analysis_Specifications>
    1. **Multi-Period Comparisons:**
       - Always use full date_field references (e.g., L7D P7D, MTD PM, MoM PY, etc.) as provided in Table 6.
       - For metrics such as num_orders_with_revenue, item_quantity_with_revenue, and average_items_per_order (non-monetary), if a negative change is observed in a short-term period (e.g., WoW), compare against a longer period (e.g., QTD or YTD) to verify significance.
    2. **Monetary Thresholds:**
       - For financial KPIs (order_revenue, aov), always compare changes against total order_revenue. Do not report a negative change unless the ratio (current value of the partition divided by the sum for all partitions, minus the corresponding comparison value) reaches at least -10%.
       - Additionally, if the actual dollar change represents less than 2% of total order_revenue, ignore the finding.
    3. **Trend Repetition Rule:**
       - NEVER include the same metric for multiple periods if the findings are consistent. For instance, if order_revenue declines in WoW, MTD, and MoM, only show the finding in the longest relevant period (e.g., MoM) and summarize that the trend persists across other periods.
    4. **No Duplication of 'all' Partition:**
       - Partition = all represents the entire business. The sum of revenue from the individual segments (New Subscription, New One-Off, Existing Subscription, Existing One-Off) is equal to the revenue in partition = all.
       - Therefore, do not re-aggregate or duplicate data from the segmented partitions when discussing overall business performance; simply refer to the data under partition = all.
       - If discussing a specific segment, analyze the corresponding partition.
    5. **Formatting & Clarity:**
       - Use HTML headings, bullet lists, and nested sub-bullets to clearly structure your output.
       - Ensure that all date references are explicit and in the required format (e.g., MoM: “Abbreviated Month, Year”; MTD: “Abbreviated Month Day, Year”).
    6. **Final Verification:**
       - If the final structure and nesting are correct and all instructions have been followed, include the confirmation phrase as specified.
       - Always end with the required final statement.
  </Analysis_Specifications>

  <!-- (5) Style & Final Output Requirements -->
  <Style_and_Output_Requirements>
    - Your final output must be highly succinct, focusing only on essential insights.
    - Adhere strictly to the mandated final structure (Overview, Trend Analysis, Key Questions, Recommendations, Conclusion, Key Metrics).
    - Do not repeat the same data unnecessarily.
    - If Table 6 dates match exactly, include the phrase “Date-Cal-Data Confirmed.” at the relevant spot.
    - End your report with the exact final statement:
      > Revenue Report Complete. Client ID: [CLIENT_ID]
  </Style_and_Output_Requirements>

  <!-- (6) Summary & Best Practices -->
  <Summary>
    Use this expanded prompt to generate a comprehensive yet succinct revenue performance analysis report. Your deliverable must:
    - Include all mandatory sections (Overview, Trend Analysis, Key Questions, Recommendations, Conclusion, Key Metrics).
    - Categorize metrics into the four segments (New Subscription, New One-Off, Existing Subscription, Existing One-Off). Note: Not every report will contain data for both subscriptions and one-offs; however, at least one of these categories will always be present.
    - Follow all explicit rules from the <CORE_RULE> tags regarding threshold-based reporting.
    - Reference all date ranges from Table 6 using the proper formats.
    - Recognize that partition = all represents the entire business; the sum of the revenue of the individual partitions equals the revenue for partition = all. Do not duplicate or re-roll-up this data.
    - End with the final statement: “Revenue Report Complete. Client ID: [CLIENT_ID]”

<h1>Revenue Performance Analysis Report</h1>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
Current revenue performance is mixed across all segments. While Existing Subscription revenue shows positive growth, New Subscription and New One-Off segments are experiencing significant declines. The overall treeMath_score is 78.46, indicating a 'C+' grade. Analyzing MTD, MoM, QTD, YTD, WoW, L7D, L2W and RCW performance is critical for understanding recent trends and potential drivers across the business.
</p>

<h1>Trend Analysis</h1>

<h2>MTD Performance (Feb 01, 2025 â€“ Feb 20, 2025 vs. Jan 01, 2025 â€“ Jan 20, 2025) Date-Cal-Data Confirmed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>New Subscription:</b> order_revenue decreased by 22.91% (Grade F), and num_orders_with_revenue decreased by 23.62% (Grade F). This significant drop might indicate an ineffective promotional campaign (Table 7). The business impact includes increased cost per acquisition and potentially delayed break-even.</li>
        <li><b>New One-Off:</b> order_revenue decreased by 20.80% (Grade F), and num_orders_with_revenue decreased by 19.88% (Grade F). Similar to New Subscriptions, this indicates issues in attracting and converting new one-off customers.</li>
        <li><b>Existing Subscription:</b> order_revenue increased by 8.69% (Grade B) and num_orders_with_revenue increased by 10.21% (Grade B+). This indicates healthy retention and potential for upselling.</li>
        <li><b>Existing One-Off:</b> order_revenue decreased by 21.55% (Grade F), and num_orders_with_revenue decreased by 21.17% (Grade F). This segment shows a worrying trend, suggesting decreased loyalty or competitive pressure.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>MTD Year-over-Year Performance (Feb 01, 2025 â€“ Feb 20, 2025 vs. Feb 01, 2024 â€“ Feb 20, 2024) Date-Cal-Data Confirmed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>New Subscription:</b> order_revenue decreased by 4.38% (Grade D) indicating potential long-term issues in subscriber acquisition compared to last year.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>MoM PM Performance (Jan 01, 2025 â€“ Jan 31, 2025 vs. Dec 01, 2024 â€“ Dec 31, 2024) Date-Cal-Data Confirmed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>New Subscription:</b> order_revenue decreased by 23.33% (Grade F), and num_orders_with_revenue decreased by 21.32% (Grade F). This further confirms the downward trend seen in the MTD comparison, suggesting ongoing issues in new subscriber acquisition.</li>
        <li><b>all:</b> aov decreased by 2.00% (Grade D+), possibly indicating heavier discount usage or a shift towards lower-priced SKUs (Table 7).</li>
    </ul>

<h2>QTD PQ Performance (Jan 01, 2025 â€“ Feb 20, 2025 vs. Oct 01, 2024 â€“ Nov 20, 2024) Date-Cal-Data Confirmed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>New Subscription:</b> order_revenue decreased by 3.46% (Grade D+), indicating potential long-term issues in subscriber acquisition compared to last quarter.</li>
    </ul>
    
<h2>WoW PW Performance (Feb 10, 2025 â€“ Feb 16, 2025 vs. Feb 03, 2025 â€“ Feb 09, 2025) Date-Cal-Data Confirmed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>New One-Off:</b> aov decreased by 10.10% (Grade D-), possibly indicating heavier discount usage or a shift towards lower-priced SKUs (Table 7).</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Trend Consolidation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The negative trend in order_revenue and num_orders_with_revenue for New Subscription is consistently observed across WoW PW, MTD PM and MoM PM periods. This negative trend also shows up in QTD PQ, MTD PY, YTD PY and L2W PY.</li>
    </ul>

<h1>Key Questions</h1>
<ul>
    <li>What specific marketing campaigns or initiatives are underperforming, leading to the significant decline in New Subscription and New One-Off revenue and orders in MTD and MoM periods? (Ref: Table 7's possible_evaluation_and_key_diagnostic_checks)</li>
    <li>Are there any site issues, checkout glitches, or payment failures impacting the conversion rate of new customers, particularly for subscriptions? (Ref: Table 7)</li>
    <li>Why is aov decreasing for the entire business in MoM PM and the New One-Off partition in WoW PW period, and what steps can be taken to reverse this trend and maintain healthy margins? (Ref: Table 7)</li>
    <li>What are the main drivers for the Existing Subscription revenue growth, and how can these be leveraged to improve other segments' performance?</li>
    <li>Are refunds in arrears playing a role in negative YoY sales for the New Subscriptions partition?</li>
</ul>

<h1>Recommendations</h1>
<ul>
    <li><b>Immediate Fix:</b> Refine ad creative and messaging for New Subscription and New One-Off campaigns to improve conversion rates. (Possible Prescription: Table 7)</li>
    <li><b>Short-Term Fix:</b> Address any potential site issues, checkout glitches, or payment failures impacting new customer conversions. (Possible Prescription: Table 7)</li>
    <li><b>Medium-to-Long-Term Strategy:</b> Re-evaluate pricing and discount strategies across all segments to optimize aov and maintain healthy margins. (Possible Prescription: Table 7)</li>
    <li><b>Strategic Change:</b> Invest further in retention campaigns and upselling strategies for Existing Subscription customers to capitalize on their loyalty. (Possible Prescription: Insights)</li>
    <li><b>Strategic Change:</b> Evaluate product relevancy of New Subscription products through user interviews.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>
While Existing Subscription revenue is a strength, significant drops in New Subscription and New One-Off order_revenue and num_orders_with_revenue are major weaknesses. Immediate action is needed to address marketing effectiveness and site issues, alongside a strategic re-evaluation of pricing and customer acquisition. Monitoring refund rates should be a key diagnostic.

<Key_Questions>
<ul>
  <li>What factors contributed to the 28.34% decline in order_revenue for the New One-Off partition in the MTD PM period? (See Table 7 for possible_evaluation_and_key_diagnostic_checks.)</li>
  <li>Why is the Existing One-Off revenue growing whereas the New One-Off revenue declining? Is the current marketing campaign effective in acquiring new One-Off customers?</li>
  <li>Why are the New One-Off number of orders and items decreasing in most of the trends?</li>
</ul>
</Key_Questions>

<Recommendations>
<ul>
  <li><b>For the decline in New One-Off revenue:</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Short-term:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Refine ad creative and messaging to better target potential new one-off customers. (Possible Prescription: Revisit Marketing / Acquisition: Restart or optimize paused campaigns; consider new channels or retargeting.)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Medium-to-long-term:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Revise pricing strategy or explore bundling options to increase the attractiveness of one-off purchases. (Possible Prescription: Review Pricing Strategy: If competitor(s) undercut you, consider loyalty perks or bundling.)</li>
          <li>Evaluate current acquisition channels for effectiveness and explore new channels. (Possible Prescription: New Channel / Traffic Source: Perhaps a new source or new affiliate partnership that is driving volume has recently been added?)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>To capitalize on Existing One-Off revenue growth:</b>
      <ul>
          <li>Analyze which marketing is influencing the existing base and allocate more to that.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</Recommendations>

<Conclusion>
Overall, the business shows strength in retaining Existing One-Off customers, but it is struggling to acquire new One-Off customers. A significant drop in New One-Off order_revenue is offset by the stability of Existing One-Off revenue. Immediate actions should focus on optimizing marketing and promotional strategies to attract more new One-Off customers, while medium-term strategies should consider adjustments to pricing, acquisition channels, and customer retention programs.
