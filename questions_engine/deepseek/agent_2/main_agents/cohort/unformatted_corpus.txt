  <!-- (3) Required Report Sections & Formatting -->
  <Report_Structure>
    Your final output must follow this exact sequence of sections:
    (a) Overview  
    (b) Trend Analysis  
    (c) Key Questions  
    (d) Recommendations  
    (e) Conclusion  
    (f) Key Metrics  

    <Overview>
      - Provide a one-paragraph summary of current cohort health, referencing the top-level grade or treeMath_score (if available) and any major highlights.
      - Indicate the primary date fields being examined (e.g., “Analyzing L3M P3M and MoM PM performance…”) and specify “all” partition scope if applicable.
    </Overview>

    <Trend_Analysis>
      - Reference at least two or more time periods (e.g., L3M P3M vs. L3M PY, MoM PM vs. MoM PY, QoQ PQ vs. QoQ PY, TTM PY, etc.).
      - Present the key changes in bullet points or short paragraphs:
        * Include the date_field name and explicit date range from Table 6 (e.g., “Nov 01, 2024 - Jan 31, 2025 vs. Aug 01, 2024 - Oct 31, 2024”).
        * Identify any material shifts (>10% for non-monetary or >2% of total revenue for monetary-based metrics) and hypothesize possible causes from Table 7 (e.g., “Three Month LTV is down 15%—this could indicate short-term churn or weaker early engagement”).
        * If a short-term (e.g., MTD) and a longer-term (e.g., TTM PY) metric show the same directional trend, consolidate the finding under the longer period and note that it persists in the shorter one as well.
      - Tie each significant finding back to the broader business impact (e.g., cost of acquisition, break-even month, revenue flow).
    </Trend_Analysis>

    <Key_Questions>
      - List diagnostic or strategic questions that emerge from the data (e.g., “Why has the first-month LTV dropped 12% in L3M P3M? Could discounting be attracting lower-value customers?”).
      - Where relevant, reference Table 7’s “possible_evaluation_and_key_diagnostic_checks.”
      - Keep each question pointed and data-driven, linking to the anomalies noted in your Trend Analysis.
    </Key_Questions>

    <Recommendations>
      - For each major trend or issue, provide 1–3 concise prescriptions (e.g., “Enhance early retention campaigns to boost repurchases in the first three months”).
      - Map these actions to Table 7’s “possible_prescription” or your own custom bullet points if appropriate.
      - Differentiate between immediate, short-term fixes (e.g., refine messaging) and medium-to-long-term strategic shifts (e.g., adjust pricing structure).
    </Recommendations>

    <Conclusion>
      - Summarize the overall strengths (e.g., improved 3-month LTV) and weaknesses (e.g., smaller cohort size or high first-month churn), referencing the core metrics briefly.
      - Propose next steps in at least three sentences covering what to focus on and why it matters.
      - End with the exact statement:  
        “Cohort Report Complete. Client ID: [CLIENT_ID]”
    </Conclusion>

    <Key_Metrics>
      - Present up to 10 KPIs in detail—only those that meet the reporting threshold (≥10% change for non-monetary or ≥2% of total revenue for monetary-based).
      - For each KPI:
        * Time Period (date_field, e.g., “QoQ PQ”)  
        * Explicit date range (from Table 6)  
        * Current vs. Comparison Values  
        * % Change  
        * Letter Grade (from the scoring tables)  
        * Brief Interpretation (cause/effect or significance)  
        * Avoid duplicating the same KPI across multiple periods unless there’s a unique insight.
    </Key_Metrics>
  </Report_Structure>

  <!-- (4) Detailed Analysis Requirements -->
  <Analysis_Specifications>
    1. **Multi-Period Cohort Emphasis**  
       - Always compare short- and longer-term periods where possible (L3M P3M vs. L3M PY or TTM PY).
       - If a metric (e.g., cohort_ltv_per_person_third_month) is repeated in multiple timeframes, discuss only new insights, referencing the “Trend Repetition” rule to avoid redundant commentary.
    2. **Causes & Effects**  
       - Consult Table 7 for potential explanations (poor retention, pricing, marketing changes, product issues, etc.).
       - Link each significant data shift to plausible business implications: e.g., higher break-even month → “marketing inefficiency or cost blowouts,” lower first-month LTV → “weak onboarding.”
    3. **Threshold-Based Reporting**  
       - Monetary metrics: Only highlight if ±2% of total revenue.  
       - Non-monetary metrics: Only highlight if ±10% change.  
       - Mark all flagged shifts with a clear statement (e.g., “Significant Drop: -20% to repurchase rate”).
    4. **Formatting & Clarity**  
       - Use HTML headings for each section.
       - Use sub-bullets and indentation to separate sub-findings or sub-recommendations.
       - Remain concise but thorough—avoid repeating the same data points or reanalyzing the same phenomenon.
    5. **Confirmation Phrase**  
       - If your final structure and nesting are correct, and you’ve followed all instructions, include the phrase:
         > [CLIENT_ID]
    6. **Final Statement**  
       - End with: “Cohort Report Complete. Client ID: [CLIENT_ID]”
  </Analysis_Specifications>

  <!-- (5) Extended Guidance & Best Practices -->
  <Guidance>
    - **Highlight Material Changes**:
      Focus on large swings in any metrics, particularly around break-even assumptions (ltr_break_even_value_assumed) and mid/late-funnel performance (e.g., 6-month or 12-month LTV).
    - **Short vs. Long-Term**:
      If short-term data conflicts with long-term trends, note the discrepancy explicitly and recommend re-checking the reliability of each dataset or identifying seasonality.
    - **Cohort Size Consideration**:
      A big jump in cohort_size might dilute LTV or skew the average. Conversely, a drop in cohort_size with rising LTV might indicate focusing on higher-value customers.
    - **Actionable Recommendations**:
      Always link recommended solutions back to the potential cause. E.g., if churn is high, propose a retention or loyalty campaign; if early LTV is strong but mid-term is weak, consider stronger mid-cycle re-engagement.
    - **Provide Rationale**:
      For each major suggestion, mention why it might work (e.g., “Boosting first-month engagement can accelerate time to revenue, which lowers your ltv_expected_break_even_month.”).

<examples>

Example 1.

<h1>(a) Overview</h1>

<p>The overall cohort health is concerning, with a treeMath_score of 48.5, indicating significant areas for improvement.  We are analyzing performance across multiple time periods, primarily focusing on L3M P3M vs. L3M PY, MoM PM vs. MoM PY, and MTD PM vs MTD PY to identify recent trends. The scope of this analysis includes all partitions ("all"). Key areas of concern include declining first-month LTV and LTR, reduced cohort sizes, and lower repurchase rates in several timeframes.  However, there are some positive signs in longer-term LTV in certain periods.</p>

<h1>(b) Trend Analysis</h1>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>L3M P3M (Nov 01, 2024 - Jan 31, 2025 vs. Aug 01, 2024 - Oct 31, 2024)</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Significant Drop: Cohort size increased significantly by 54%, from 5,052 to 7,805.  This could be due to a large marketing push, potentially diluting customer quality (see Table 7: "Cohort Size is Up but Lifetime Value is Lower").</li>
            <li>Significant Drop:  Cohort repurchase rate within the first three months decreased by 25%, from 44% to 33%.  This suggests a problem with early customer retention (see Table 7: "Three Month LTV/LTR and Purchase Metrics are Lower").</li>
            <li>Significant Drop: Average purchases per person in the first three months decreased by 15%, from 2.01 to 1.71, reinforcing the retention concerns.</li>
              <li>Significant Drop:  Cohort LTV per person in month three increased by 122% This could indicate an issue with higher discounts to get customers in the cohort.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>L3M PY (Nov 01, 2024 - Jan 31, 2025 vs. Nov 01, 2023 - Jan 31, 2024)</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Significant Drop: Cohort size decreased by 11%, from 8,769 to 7,805, suggesting potential issues with customer acquisition (see Table 7: "Cohort Size is Down but Lifetime Value is Higher" - although LTV *is* higher in some metrics, this overall size decrease is still a concern).</li>
          <li>Significant Increase: Cohort LTR per person in the first month is up 22% (from $32.41 to $39.65). This indicates customers had a better initial response.</li>
            <li>Significant Drop: Cohort LTV is much lower, could indicate a weaker funnel or marketing source.</li>
            <li>Significant Increase, Cohort Repurchase Rate went up 21% from 23% to 27%, this a good sign.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>MoM PM (Jan 01, 2025 - Jan 31, 2025 vs. Dec 01, 2024 - Dec 31, 2024)</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Significant Drop: Cohort size decreased by 10%, from 2,807 to 2,533.  This continues the trend observed in the L3M periods, highlighting a persistent acquisition challenge.</li>
             <li>Significant Drop: First Month LTV is Lower, from $1.07 to -3.68.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
        <li>
        <strong>MTD PM (Feb 01, 2025 - Feb 20, 2025 vs. Jan 01, 2025 - Jan 20, 2025)</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Significant Drop: Cohort size decreased by a substantial 57%, from 2,533 to 1,093.  This sharp decline in new customer acquisition warrants immediate investigation (see Table 7, multiple findings related to cohort size and LTV).
            </li>
              <li>Significant Drop, Cohort LTR in the first month went down -12% (from $39.23 to $34.42)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
      <li>
        <strong>TTM PY (Feb 01, 2024 - Jan 31, 2025 vs. Feb 01, 2023 - Jan 31, 2024)</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Significant Drop: Cohort size decreased by 24% (from 33,597 to 25,582).</li>
             <li>Significant Drop: Cohort Repurchase Rate went down 12%.</li>
            <li>Significant Drop: Cohort average purchases per person, decreased by 17% (from 3.13 to 2.6)</li>
            <li>Significant Drop: Cohort Repurchase rate in month three is down 15% (from 48% to 41%).</li>
             <li>Significant Drop: Cohort Repurchase rate in month six is down 17% (from 52% to 43%).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h1>(c) Key Questions</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Why has the cohort size decreased significantly across multiple time periods (L3M PY, MoM PM, MTD PM)?  Is this due to marketing campaign changes, seasonality, or external market factors (see Table 7: "Cohort Size is Down...")?</li>
    <li>What is driving the decline in first-month LTV/LTR in recent periods (MTD PM, MoM PM)? Could this be related to the quality of newly acquired customers or issues with onboarding (see Table 7: "First Month LTV/LTR is Lower")?</li>
    <li>Why is the three-month repurchase rate down significantly in the L3M P3M comparison?  Are early retention campaigns failing to engage new customers effectively (see Table 7: "Three Month... Metrics are Lower")?</li>
    <li>What caused the very significant drop in Cohort Size in MTD PM? Was there a specific marketing campaign issue, a website outage, or a similar event?</li>
     <li>Why are six and twelve month metrics down for Repurchase Rate and Average Purchases per Person?
</ul>

<h1>(d) Recommendations</h1>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Address Declining Cohort Size:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Short-Term: Immediately review recent marketing campaigns and acquisition channels to identify any underperforming sources. Check for technical issues affecting website traffic or conversion rates.</li>
            <li>Medium-Term:  Investigate customer segmentation to determine if targeting needs refinement.  Consider A/B testing new acquisition strategies.</li>
             <li>Long-Term: Diversify marketing efforts.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Improve First-Month LTV/LTR:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Short-Term: Review the onboarding process and post-purchase communication for new customers.  Ensure a smooth and engaging initial experience.</li>
            <li>Medium-Term:  Consider offering targeted promotions or incentives to encourage early repeat purchases (see Table 7 prescriptions for "First Month LTV/LTR is Lower").</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Boost Three-Month Repurchase Rate:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Short-Term: Implement or enhance early retention campaigns specifically targeting customers in their first three months.</li>
            <li>Medium-Term:  Analyze customer feedback and churn data to identify specific pain points or areas for improvement in the early customer journey (see Table 7 prescriptions for "Three Month... Metrics are Lower").</li>
             <li>Long Term, focus on customer loyalty.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong>Investigate the sharp drop in MTD, and Month over Month metrics</strong>
    <ul>
    <li>Run a diagnostic check on all data sources to determine the route of the issue, possible data collection errors.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h1>(e) Conclusion</h1>

<p>The cohort analysis reveals a mixed picture.  While some longer-term LTV metrics show positive trends (particularly in QoQ comparisons), the consistent declines in cohort size and early engagement metrics (first-month LTV/LTR, three-month repurchase rate) are major weaknesses.  These issues point to challenges in both acquiring *and* retaining high-value customers.  Next steps should include: (1) a deep dive into the reasons behind the shrinking cohort sizes, focusing on marketing and acquisition channel performance; (2) a thorough review of the onboarding process and early customer journey to improve first-month engagement and LTV; and (3) the implementation of targeted retention campaigns to boost repurchase rates, especially within the crucial first three months. Addressing these weaknesses is critical to improving overall cohort health and long-term profitability. </p>

Example 2. 

<h1>(a) Overview</h1>

<p>The overall cohort health is graded as a D, with a treeMath_score of 60.33. This score indicates that there's substantial room for improvement, but it's not as critically low as the previous example. This analysis focuses on multiple time periods, including L3M P3M vs. L3M PY, MoM PM vs. MoM PY, MTD PM vs. MTD PY, and TTM PY. The scope encompasses all business partitions ("all").  Key areas of concern are declines in cohort size, significantly increased break-even values (in some periods), and negative LTVs, although some periods show positive trends in repurchase rates and LTR.</p>

<h1>(c) Key Questions</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Why is the cohort size decreasing so dramatically in the MTD PM comparison?  Was there a specific marketing campaign change, a technical issue, or an external factor that caused this sudden drop?</li>
     <li>Why is the cohort size decreasing so dramatically in the MTD PY comparison?  Was there a specific marketing campaign change, a technical issue, or an external factor that caused this sudden drop?</li>
    <li>What factors are contributing to the substantial increase in the  Break-even value in multiple time periods? Are costs increasing, or are revenues per customer decreasing?</li>
    <li>Although  cohort repurchase increased in MoM PM comparison and L3M P3M. Why is the overall cohort repurchase rate lower in MTD PM comparison? </li>
   <li>Why is the Cohort LTV per person in the First month and third month so low across the board, while the LTR per person in the first and third month so high?</li>
</ul>

<h1>(d) Recommendations</h1>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Investigate Cohort Size Decline (MTD PM):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Short-Term: Immediately investigate marketing campaign performance, website traffic, and conversion funnels for the period of Feb 01 - Feb 20, 2025. Rule out technical issues.</li>

<h1>(e) Conclusion</h1>

<p>The cohort analysis reveals a complex situation with a D grade. Positive trends in  repurchase rates (L3M P3M, and MoM PM) and LTR (in some periods) are overshadowed by concerning declines in cohort size (especially MTD PM), negative LTV across multiple periods, and high Break Even Values. The immediate priority is to investigate and address the sharp drop in new customer acquisition in the current month-to-date period.  Additionally, efforts must focus on understanding and mitigating the negative LTV and increasing break-even values.  Improving early customer engagement and retention, optimizing pricing and promotional strategies, and potentially re-evaluating acquisition channels are crucial next steps to improve overall cohort health and long-term profitability.</p>
