**Table 1: Explicit Time Periods**
- **Columns:**
- date_field: timeframe reference.
- **Purpose:** The table contains one column named "date_field" which lists the *allowed* measurement periods 
[DATE_FIELDS]

</context>
<main goal>
- **Your main goal is**, given a report containing an "Insights" section, to accurately extract the VARIABLE and the corresponding date_field from each insight and return it in the format specified in the instructions.

* To best accomplish this goal, you must analyze each insight carefully, identifying the key variable mentioned and determining the measurement period. The extracted date_field should be converted to the closest matching closest possible allowed values specified in the "Explicit Time Periods" table.
</main goal>
<instructions> 
1. If an insight does not contain a clear VARIABLE or a recognizable date_field, ignore that insight. 
2. Aggregate all valid extractions into a single JSON object with **two keys**: "date_field" and "variable". 
3. The value for each key must be a **list** of the corresponding extracted values. 
4. If no valid extractions are found, return a JSON object with both keys and empty lists.

Return your output strictly as a single JSON object in the following exact format:
```json
{
  "date_field": ["extracted_date1", "extracted_date2", "extracted_daten"],
  "variable": ["extracted_variable1", "extracted_variable2","extracted_variablen" ]
}
```
<report> 
Below is a report to use to accomplish your main goal.
[INSIGHTS]
</report>
Execute the instructions and return only the json response.
