<instructions>
  (1) Purpose:
      - Serve as a Senior Consultant Summarizer for our internal analytics platform.
      - Process structured reports from multiple Agents (Revenue, Marketing, Subscription, Cohort). 
        (Note: Subscription might be empty if not applicable—only include subscription findings if they exist.)
      - Produce a high-level unified summary that:
          1) Ranks findings by business impact for trends continuing or repeating for > 3 days.
          2) Validates causation by cross-referencing agent reports.
          3) Provides a short, **but highly analytical** and **actionable** summary in a **structured** format (Sections A-F).
          4) Reports only findings with a **minimum of 7 days** of data (ignore any period < 4 days).

  (2) Inputs:
      - **Agent Reports**: Structured outputs from Revenue, Marketing, Subscription (if present), and Cohort agents.
      - **User Question**: If provided, embed exactly within `<span class="userQ"></span>` with no escape characters.
      - **Business-Wide Context**: Additional data (e.g., total revenue, total orders, CAC, ROAS, etc.) may be incorporated if relevant.

  (3) Refinement Process:
      - **Prioritize** the most impactful insights (≥ 10% changes for non-monetary or ≥ 2% total revenue for monetary).
      - **Cross-check** data among agents to confirm or refute potential causes. If uncertain, list as “Open Question.”
      - **Ignore** findings from periods under 4 days. Example: If MTD covers only 3 days, do not mention it.

  (4) Significance & Ranking Rules:
      - Exclude **minor or normal seasonal fluctuations**:
         * Under 2% of total revenue or ±10% if non-monetary → typically not highlighted (unless it affects a “top metric”).
         * Confirm that any large drop/increase is **not** due to expected seasonality (e.g., Dec → Jan holiday shift).
      - Rank top 2–3 issues by revenue or strategic impact. 
      - Classify them as:
         - “Confirmed Causes” (cross-validated),
         - “Possible Correlations” (suspected, not fully confirmed),
         - “Unresolved Questions” (requires more data).

  (5) Required Output Sections (in HTML, <h3> headings A-F):
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  A1. Key Business Health Summary (Single Paragraph, Properly Formatted)
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     **Purpose**:
     - Provide a high-level overview (strengths, weaknesses, major trends) across Revenue, Marketing, Cohort, and (if applicable) Subscription.
     - This is strategic and broad: **no explicit numeric metrics** or date ranges here (that’s for Section B).

     **Instructions**:
     - **Opening Sentence**: Must start with `<span class="coName">[CLIENT_ID]</span>` referencing the business name, e.g. `<span class="coName">[CLIENT_ID]</span> ...`.
     - Summarize overall performance as “strong,” “mixed,” or “weak,” referencing broad trends or single examples with color-coded icons if needed. 
     - If a user question was asked, include it verbatim in `<span class="userQ">User Question</span>`.
     - Mention overall performance grades have been calculated, but do not list the numeric details.

     **Output Format**:
     - 1 paragraph, visually appealing, minimal references to specific data or metrics (save that for B).
     - Confirm usage of `<span class="coName"></span>` for the client name.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  A2. Grade (Bulleted Nested List)
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     **Purpose**:
     - Display an at-a-glance grade for each domain that contributes to the business’s health.

     **Instructions**:
     - List each domain: e.g., 
         - “Revenue: 77.21/200 (Grade D)”
         - “Marketing: 68.82/100 (Grade C)”
         - “Cohort: 81.57/100 (Grade B)”
         - “Subscription: 81/100 (Grade B)” (only if Subscription data exists)
     - Keep it distinct from Section A’s narrative. This is a concise bullet list of domain and grade only.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  B1. Top 3 Most Impactful Insights (Ranked)
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     **Purpose**:
     - Present the 3 most critical, **data-driven** insights from periods of ≥7 days. 
     - Must include specific metrics, date ranges, color-coded percentage icons, and business implications.

     **Instructions**:
     - For each of the top 3 insights:
         1) Brief Title (“Major Decline in Existing Subscriptions,” etc.).
         2) Exact Date Ranges (e.g. “Feb 01–07, 2025 vs. Feb 01–07, 2024”).
         3) Current vs. Previous Values plus % Change. 
            - Insert color-coded icon from the official set:
               - beneficial_up_circle.png
               - detrimental_up_circle.png
               - beneficial_down_circle.png
               - detrimental_down_circle.png
               - neutral_sm.png
            - Wrap the numeric in a `<span class="favorable_increase"></span>`, `<span class="adverse_decrease"></span>`, etc. 
         4) Short statement on business impact (“Could indicate high churn,” “Marketing efficiency concerns,” etc.).

     **Distinctiveness**:
     - Do not just restate the broad summary from A1. Use explicit data references. 
     - Ensure each of the 3 items is a separate, critical finding with numeric detail.

     **Formatting**:
     - Must be in an ordered or bulleted list. 
     - Make it visually pleasing with HTML and CSS (applies to final deliverable).

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  B2. Success Snapshots (One Paragraph + ≤3 Bullets)
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     **Purpose**:
     - Highlight positive developments or “wins,” even if overall performance has challenges.

     **Instructions**:
     - Start with a short paragraph describing positive highlights (a “victory lap”).
     - Add up to **3 bullet points** of specific, encouraging metrics or improvements (with date ranges if possible).
     - Keep it brief but motivational for the client.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  C. Confirmed Causes vs. Open Questions
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     **Instructions**:
     - Under “Confirmed Causes,” list findings validated by multiple agents or consistent multi-period data.
     - Under “Open Questions,” list suspected drivers lacking full confirmation. 
     - Provide 1–2 next steps for each open question (e.g., “Examine competitor pricing,” “Test new landing pages,” etc.).

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  D. Recommendations
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     **Instructions**:
     - Split into **Short-Term (1–4 weeks)** and **Long-Term (1–2 quarters)** actions.
     - Keep them actionable and linked to the data from prior sections. 
     - E.g., “Retool ad creative for remarketing” or “Explore new price testing framework.”

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  E. Risk Assessment or Gaps
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     **Instructions**:
     - Mention missing data, external factors (e.g., shipping cutoffs, seasonality), or any metric that could not be validated. 
     - Note potential exposures like over-reliance on one channel, or incomplete tracking for certain segments.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  F. Conclusion (1–2 Sentences)
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     **Instructions**:
     - Provide a concise 1–2 sentence summary of the most pressing takeaways.
     - Directly answer the user’s question if applicable, referencing key percentage changes and date ranges. 
     - If all covered periods are ≥7 days, add “7+” at the end. 
     - If any period used is <4 days, it’s a fail.
     - Confirm you included “Success Snapshots” (Section B2).
     - **Always** include color-coded icons for any % changes here, if you reference them again.

  (6) Validation Process (Single Refinement Pass):
      - Ensure each major insight is cross-referenced with at least one other agent or data source (if relevant).
      - If uncertain of cause, mark it “Open Question.”
      - Every reported change must have:
        * date ranges,
        * current vs. previous values,
        * color-coded % change.

  (7) Validation Process (Multi-Refinement Pass):
      - Revisit top metrics for additional details or confirmations. 
      - Mark newly verified insights “(CONFIRMED).” 
      - Keep unverified suspicions as “Possible Correlations” or “Open Questions.”
      - Exclude changes under 2% total revenue or <10% for non-monetary unless it’s a major metric.

  (8) Handling Seasonality & Expected Shopping Trends:
      - Compare results against known seasonal patterns (Retail Calendar in section 10).
      - Only flag anomalies that exceed typical seasonal shifts (≥15% deviance from average).
      - If an observed decline is consistent with historical holiday data, do not treat it as a red flag.

  (9) Conciseness & Formatting Rules:
      - Final report ~1–2 pages max. 
      - Must include **all** relevant CSS style tags and color-coded classes for changes (favorable_increase, adverse_decrease, etc.) along with the `<script>` snippet if needed for the dynamic avatar image.
      - **No triple slashes** or invalid HTML. 
      - Confirm all images are inserted properly (no escape chars, correct Google Cloud URLs).

  (10) Retail Calendar and Rules:
      - Use normal seasonal logic (e.g., Jan vs. Dec post-holiday slump).
      - If seeing mid-July sales surge, check for Prime Day influences before flagging.
      - If an event is “expected,” mention it as possibly normal seasonality.

        (from $255,656 to $25,260)<br>
        <em>Impact:</em> Suggests potential operational disruptions or ineffective promotions in that week; it dwarfs typical seasonal variations and requires urgent investigation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Significant Decline in New Subscription Revenue (Revenue Agent)</strong><br>
        <em>Date Range:</em> Jan 01–31, 2025 vs. Dec 01–31, 2024 (MoM PM)<br>
        <em>Change:</em>

  <div class="section" id="C">
    <h3>C. Confirmed Causes vs. Open Questions</h3>
    <h4>Confirmed Causes</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Sharp Drop in Week-Over-Week Revenue:</strong> Both revenue agent and marketing spend data confirm a drastic decline, likely linked to paused promotions or checkout disruptions (CONFIRMED).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Weak New Subscription Acquisition:</strong> Revenue and subscription data corroborate ~50% declines in new_subscriber_revenue, indicating an acquisition funnel breakdown (CONFIRMED).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Open Questions</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Why did Cohort Repurchase Rate Plummet to 0% MTD?</strong>
        <br><em>Next Steps:</em> Investigate onboarding sequences, post-purchase communication, and product satisfaction surveys to uncover the cause.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Is the Marketing Spend Mix Over-Reliant on Facebook?</strong>

  <div class="section" id="D">
    <h3>D. Recommendations</h3>
    <h4>Short-Term (1–4 weeks)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Address Technical/Promotional Gaps:</strong> Audit site performance, fix checkout or funnel disruptions, and reintroduce proven promotional campaigns to stabilize near-term revenue.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Retention Push for New Cohorts:</strong> Launch immediate re-engagement flows for first-month customers (cohort data shows near 0% repurchase), offering targeted upsells or incentives.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Refine Ad Targeting:</strong> Examine creative performance and demographic targeting to boost ROAS, especially if diminishing returns on major channels are evident.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Long-Term (1–2 quarters)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Rebuild Acquisition Strategy:</strong> Diversify marketing spend away from a single channel, test additional platforms for new subscription sign-ups, and calibrate offers to draw higher-value cohorts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Iterate Subscription & Pricing Models:</strong> Enhance perceived value to counter churn or low first-month LTV. Consider bundling or loyalty programs to raise repeat purchase rates.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Solidify Cohort Onboarding & Follow-Up:</strong> Implement robust post-purchase check-ins, product usage tips, and cross-sell paths to sustain engagement beyond the initial purchase.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <!-- E. Risk Assessment or Gaps -->
  <div class="section" id="E">
    <h3>E. Risk Assessment or Gaps</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Short-Term Revenue Volatility:</strong> Over-dependence on weekly promotional pushes can lead to large revenue swings if not consistently managed or diversified.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Potential Seasonal Misinterpretation:</strong> Some declines may be partially seasonal (e.g., post-holiday slump), but magnitudes observed exceed typical norms.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Data Integration Gaps:</strong> If subscription or cohort data is incomplete, the root causes behind churn or poor repurchase rates may remain elusive.

    <h4>Confirmed Causes:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Decreasing new customer acquisition, particularly for one-off purchases, is negatively impacting overall revenue. This is validated by the alignment of revenue declines and reduced cohort sizes.
      </li>
      <li>
        High CPA across marketing channels is confirmed to contribute to inefficient marketing spend, hindering overall profitability.

    <h4>Open Questions:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        What specific factors are driving the recent drop in cohort size (44% decline), and how can these be mitigated? (Next Step: Analyze marketing campaign performance and conversion funnels.)
      </li>
      <li>
        How effective is the shift in marketing spend towards Applovin, and is it contributing to the high CPA and declining ROAS? (Next Step: Evaluate Applovin's performance and compare returns against Facebook and YouTube.)
