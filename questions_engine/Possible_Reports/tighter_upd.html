        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="narrative">
        <strong>Narrative Summary:</strong> The business continues to grow steadily. While overall order revenue increased by 3%, and traffic is up by 7%, a slight dip in the conversion rate (from 3.5% to 3.2%) suggests potential friction in the checkout flow. Marketing spend remains efficient with a healthy MER and ROAS, though a recent uptick in CPM signals increasing competition. Subscription metrics are positive with growth in the active base; however, churn is on the higher side and warrants further review. Cohort performance remains promising, with repeat purchase behavior and LTV exceeding initial targets.

    <!-- Conversion Funnel & Revenue Breakdown -->
    <h2>3. Conversion Funnel & Revenue Breakdown</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Funnel Overview:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Site Visits:</strong> 125,000</li>
        <li><strong>Clicks (from ads/organic):</strong> 25,000 <em>(Implying an average drop-off of ~80% from visit to click)</em></li>
        <li><strong>Orders:</strong> 4,000 <em>(Conversion from click to order: 16%)</em></li>

      <h3>Revenue Insights:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Order Revenue:</strong> $450,000</li>

      <p class="narrative">
        <strong>Observations:</strong> The significant drop from visits to clicks may be normal for this channel mix; however, optimizing landing pages could further improve engagement. The decrease in CVR points toward a possible friction point at the checkout stage; testing a simplified checkout process is recommended.

      </ul>
      <p class="narrative">
