  <h2>1. OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p>
    Our analysis shows a mixed picture over the most recent two-week (L2W) and recent comparison week (RCW PY) periods. While key efficiency metrics such as the Marketing Efficiency Ratio (MER) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) display improvements, the cost per acquisition (CPA) continues to climb. Additionally, shifts in spend mix – especially with increased allocation to Applovin versus a reduced share for Facebook in the year-over-year period – are likely influencing the underlying cost dynamics. Overall, these trends suggest targeted adjustments in channel strategies could help reinforce efficiency gains while curbing rising costs.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>2. TREND ANALYSIS</h2>
  
  <h3>A. L2W P2W (Feb 10 – Feb 24, 2025 vs. Jan 27 – Feb 09, 2025):</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>MER</strong> rose from 1.44 to 1.60 (+11%). This improvement indicates better revenue generation relative to spend.</li>
    <li><strong>CPA</strong> fell from $100.56 to $95.39 (-5%), a positive trend although the absolute cost remains on the higher side.</li>
    <li><strong>ROAS</strong> increased from 0.73 to 0.80 (+9%), suggesting that every marketing dollar is yielding more revenue.</li>
    <li>However, <strong>CPM</strong> jumped dramatically by 48% and <strong>CPC</strong> increased by 10%, signaling rising costs per impression and click that could eventually pressure acquisition expenses if not addressed.</li>
    <li>Marketing spend was slightly lower (-2%), keeping budget allocations relatively constant in the period examined.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>B. L2W PY (Feb 10 – Feb 24, 2025 vs. Feb 10 – Feb 24, 2024):</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>MER</strong> improved by 10% (from 1.46 to 1.60), mirroring the recent two-week improvement.</li>
    <li><strong>CPA</strong> increased sharply from $83.54 to $95.39 (+14%). While efficiency ratios are better, the rising CPA demands attention.</li>
    <li><strong>ROAS</strong> improved modestly by 5% (0.76 to 0.80).</li>
    <li>Notably, <strong>CPM</strong> declined by 20% (from $0.03 to $0.02), which is a favorable sign, though <strong>CPC</strong> rose by 4%.</li>
    <li>Marketing spend saw a 7% increase, possibly reflecting a broader investment in campaigns that now distribute across multiple channels.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>C. RCW PY (Feb 16 – Feb 22, 2025 vs. Feb 18 – Feb 24, 2024):</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>MER</strong> shows the strongest improvement—a 14% increase (from 1.45 to 1.66), suggesting that the most recent weekly campaigns are more revenue-efficient relative to spend.</li>
    <li><strong>CPA</strong> increased by 11% (from $83.52 to $92.76).</li>
    <li><strong>ROAS</strong> improved by 9% (from 0.76 to 0.83), aligning with overall positive revenue-generation trends.</li>
    <li><strong>CPM</strong> dropped by 15% (from $0.03 to $0.02), reducing the cost of exposures, while <strong>CPC</strong> ticked up by 5%.</li>
    <li>Marketing spend in this short RCW period increased by 10%, which may partly explain the higher CPA even as efficiency ratios (MER and ROAS) improve.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>3. SPEND MIX ANALYSIS</h2>
  <p>
    Looking at spend mix trends in the year-over-year context (applicable to L2W PY and RCW PY since weekly spend mix data is available primarily for these longer comparison periods):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Applovin allocation moved from 0.00% in the comparison period to 10.00% in the current period. This significant channel introduction (or ramp-up) implies that additional budget is being allocated outside of traditional platforms.</li>
    <li>Simultaneously, Facebook's share declined from 88–87% in the past year to 72–71% recently (an absolute drop of roughly 16–18%).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The shift from a dominant allocation toward Facebook to a new weighting toward Applovin marks a strategic realignment. While the lower CPMs in RCW PY and L2W PY indicate cost savings on impressions, the increased CPA across all periods might reflect that the new channel mix is still in its optimization phase or that the creative and targeting strategies on these new channels require further fine-tuning. In turn, this could affect overall campaign efficiency if not carefully managed.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>4. KEY QUESTIONS</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>What factors are driving the rising CPA even as MER and ROAS improve? Is higher competition on certain platforms or suboptimal conversion funnel performance contributing?</li>
    <li>How is the new allocation to Applovin performing compared with historical Facebook spend? Are the lower impression costs translating into efficient customer acquisitions?</li>
    <li>Given the jump in CPM and CPC in L2W P2W, are there recent changes in audience targeting or bidding strategies that might be inadvertently driving up user acquisition costs?</li>
    <li>Is the near-zero conversion rate (CVR at 0.00%) a data reporting anomaly or an indication of issues at the landing page/checkout stages?</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>5. RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Review channel-level performance metrics for Applovin versus Facebook to validate whether the reallocation is sustainable. Consider deeper A/B testing on creative assets and audience segments on both channels.</li>
    <li>Investigate the rising CPC and CPM metrics in L2W P2W. Adjust bidding strategies and refine audience targeting to mitigate these cost increases.</li>
    <li>Since CPA trends are upward, perform a granular analysis of the conversion funnel to identify if a disconnect exists between clicks/impressions and actual conversions.</li>
    <li>Confirm the accuracy of conversion data (CVR at 0.00%) by cross-referencing web analytics and sales data; address any tracking issues immediately.</li>
    <li>Reevaluate the overall spend mix periodically and correlate shifts with performance changes to ensure that budget reallocation (e.g., increased spend on Applovin) effectively optimizes overall marketing efficiency.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>6. CONCLUSION</h2>
  <p>
    The recent weekly trends show promising gains in marketing efficiency as indicated by improvements in MER and ROAS across both L2W P2W and RCW PY—but these are counterbalanced by rising CPA levels and inconsistent cost-per-click and cost-per-impression metrics. The significant shift in spend mix, especially the introduction of Applovin and reduction in Facebook allocation, suggests a strategic pivot that may offer long-term benefits once further optimized. Immediate next steps include conducting detailed funnel analytics and channel-specific performance reviews, as well as verifying data integrity on conversion metrics to drive further improvements in overall marketing health.

  <h2>Key Questions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>What caused the significant increase in spend_mix_Facebook and spend_mix_Non Brand Search in MTD PY, L2W PY, and RCW PY?</li>
    <li>Why is CVR consistently at 0.00% across all periods? Is there a tracking issue?</li>
    <li>How can CPA be reduced to improve ROAS and overall marketing efficiency?</li>
  </ol>

  <hr>

  <h2>Recommendations</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Investigate CVR Tracking:</strong> Immediately investigate the conversion tracking setup to ensure data accuracy. The 0.00% CVR across all periods is highly unusual and likely indicates a technical issue.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Optimize Facebook Campaigns:</strong> With the increased spend_mix_Facebook, ensure campaigns are optimized for the target audience and creative is compelling.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Re-evaluate Channel Allocation:</strong> Re-evaluate spend allocation between Facebook and Non-Brand Search. Consider shifting budget back to Shopping and TikTok to leverage more efficient channels.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>A/B Test Ad Creatives:</strong> Conduct A/B testing on ad creatives to improve engagement and conversion rates, particularly on Facebook and Non-Brand Search campaigns.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <hr>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    While MER has improved year-over-year, rising CPA and declining ROAS are concerning. The substantial shift in spend mix towards Facebook and Non Brand Search, coupled with a potential tracking issue with CVR, requires immediate attention. Re-evaluating channel allocation and campaign optimization are crucial steps to improve marketing efficiency and drive better returns.
